# Front End
1) Make listings prettier on GUI
~~~2) Send request from GUI to accept listing~~~
3) Edit profile screen (note: I think there should be no distinction between class taken and class enrolled. let's just do classes for now so we can get this done w/o having to mess around with other stuff that can just introduce bugs and make it take longer to finish)
  a) Implement /profile/addclass route
    {classDept: 'MATH', classNum: '121'}
  b) Implement /profile/removeclass route
    {classDept: 'MATH', classNum: '121'}
  c) Implement /profile/changescreenname route
    {newName: 'John Doe'}
4) Add password reset button (the way I did it, it just emails a new random password... depending on time Nate can give ability to type a new one but this should be low priority)
5) Tell user what password strength requirements are
6) New Request screen
  a) Make it prettier
  b) Change the class name field from a textbox to a dropdown. use the /profile/get route (there are no parameters), they get returned like this:
  {
    "classes": [{
      "classid": 1,
      "stringName": "ACCT 101"
      }, {
      "classid": 200,
      "stringName": "ANTH 601"
      }
    ],
    "email": "qtadmin@case.edu",
    "screenname": "admin"
  }


# Back End
~~~1) Fix memory leak bug with socketio, clear dict on logout~~~
~~~2) Send a socketIO upon posting a request to push notifications for other users~~~
3) Write web service that handles accepting request
  a) Add pair to database
  b) Open a socketIO between tutee and tutor to start chat
~~~4) Fix bug allowing unconfirmed user to log in~~~
