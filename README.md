This was a group project for EECS 395: Senior Project at Case Western Reserve University.

It was originally source controlled on a server local to CWRU, but I've copied it over here for reference in the future. It's a peer tutoring application where CWRU students would be able to 
request help, and any CWRU student who has experience in the class could respond to help.

It's built with Python, Flask, and SQLite. I'll update with more instructions for running in the future, but you need to run `dbSetup.py`, then `app.py`.
